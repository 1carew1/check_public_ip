The purpose of this script is to monitor the public IP and send an email out if it changes

It is currently (2017-02-04) being used on a raspberry pi to sent out emails if my public ip changes.

Note that mail -s may not work out of the box depending on what type of OS you are running on.
If on Raspberry Pi I recommend the following tutorial : http://www.sbprojects.com/projects/raspberrypi/exim4.php
